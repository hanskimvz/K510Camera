# php-rtsp-client
This is a PHP class for interacting with the RTSP protocol. It is still a work in progress.

I started this whilst experimenting with the possibility of getting an RTSP stream from a device on the server side then transcoding it so it can be played in a webpage.

This class only handles communication with the RTSP control protocol. You can activate streams on devices but you will need seperate software to receive them.

If you think this is useful then please feel free to contribute.
